## Introduction

R-Type is a modern reimagination of the classic 90's shoot'em up game. What sets our version apart is the unique feature of music analysis gameplay that generates levels procedurally. Players can use their music collection to create a personalized gaming experience.

## Features

* **Procedural Level Generation**: Utilizes music analysis to create unique levels.
* **Networked Multiplayer**: One-to-four players can fight together against the evil Bydos.
* **Customizable**: Add your songs to the game for a personalized experience.
* **Cross-Platform**: Runs on both Windows and Linux.
* **Advanced Game Engine**: Designed with architectural patterns and decoupled subsystems for rendering, networking, and game logic.

## Technologies

* **Language**: C++
* **Graphics Library**: SFML
* **Networking**: Asio
* **Build Tool**: CMake
* **Other Libraries**: FFTW3 for Fourier Transform

## Installation

### Dependencies
* C++ Compiler (GCC or MSVC)
* CMake
* SFML
* FFTW3

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/R-Type.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd R-Type
   ```
3. Create a build directory and navigate to it:
   ```
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
4. Run CMake to generate the build files:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
5. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```

## Usage

1. To add your own music to the game, create a folder in `assets/Beatmaps/name_of_the_beatmap`.
2. Add the following files to your newly created folder:
    * `Cover.jpg` - The cover image for your beatmap.
    * `Song.wave` - The audio file.
    * `Config.json` - Configuration for the beatmap. Example:

    ```json
    {
      "Name": "OurDestiny",
      "Artist": "Aven23",
      "FolderPath": "OurDestiny",
      "Difficulty": 42,
      "BPM": 42,
      "id": 2,
      "offset": 0
    }
    ```
3. Update the database in `config/Database.cfg`.
